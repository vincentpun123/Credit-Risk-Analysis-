German Credit dataset  
This dataset classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks.

This dataset comes with a cost matrix: 
``` 
      Good  Bad (predicted)  
Good   0    1   (actual)  
Bad    5    0  
```

It is worse to class a customer as good when they are bad (5), than it is to class a customer as bad when they are good (1).
